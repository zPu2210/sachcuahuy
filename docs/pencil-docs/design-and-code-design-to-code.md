## Design ↔ Code

## Overview

Pencil enables a **two-way workflow** between design and code:

- **Design → Code:** Generate components from Pencil designs
- **Code → Design:** Import existing code into Pencil

## Design → Code Workflow

### Basic Export to Code

1. **Design in Pencil** - Design your screens, layouts or individual UI components on the canvas
2. **Save the `.pen` file** in your project workspace
3. **Open AI chat** - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
4. **Ask Pencil to generate code**

### Example Prompts

**Component generation**

```
Create a React component for this button
```

```
Generate TypeScript types for this form
```

```
Export this card as a reusable component
```

**Full pages**

```
Generate a Next.js page from this design
```

```
Create a landing page component with Tailwind CSS
```

```
Export this dashboard as a React component
```

**With specific libraries**

```
Generate code using Shadcn UI components
```

```
Create this form using React Hook Form
```

```
Export using Lucide icons instead of Material Icons
```

## Code → Design Workflow

### Importing Existing Code

If you have existing components in your codebase, Pencil can recreate them visually.

**Requirements:**

- Keep the `.pen` file in the same workspace as your code
- The AI agent can access both files

**Workflow:**

1. **Open your `.pen` file**
2. **Open AI chat** - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
3. **Ask to import code**

### Example Prompts

```
Recreate the Button component from src/components/Button.tsx
```

```
Import the LoginForm from my codebase into this design
```

```
Add the Header component from src/layouts/Header.tsx
```

**What gets imported:**

- Component structure and hierarchy
- Layout and positioning
- Styling (colors, typography, spacing)

---

## Two-Way Sync

### Keeping Design and Code in Sync

The most powerful workflow combines both directions:

1. **Start with code** - Import existing components into Pencil
2. **Design improvements** - Make visual changes in Pencil
3. **Update code** - Ask AI to apply changes back to code
4. **Iterate** - Repeat as needed

---

## Variables & Design Tokens

### CSS Variables ↔ Pencil Variables

Create a synchronized design token system:

**Import CSS to Pencil:**

1. Have a `globals.css` or similar file with CSS variables
2. Ask the agent:

```
Create Pencil variables from my globals.css
```

```
Import design tokens from src/styles/tokens.css
```

**Export Pencil to CSS:**

1. Define variables in Pencil
2. Ask the agent:

```
Update globals.css with these Pencil variables
```

```
Sync these design tokens to my CSS
```

---

## Best Practices

### File Organization

**Keep.pen files in your repo:**

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   └── styles/
├── design.pen           ← Design file
└── package.json
```

**Benefits:**

- AI agent can see both design and code
- Version control tracks both together
- Easy to keep in sync

**Start new features:**

1. Design in Pencil first
2. Generate initial code
3. Refine code implementation
4. Update design if needed

**Update existing features:**

1. Import component into Pencil
2. Make design changes
3. Sync changes back to code

**Design system maintenance:**

1. Define variables in Pencil
2. Sync to CSS
3. Use variables in both design and code
4. Update once, apply everywhere

Pencil is not limited to a specific framework — you can ask the AI to generate code for any stack. Here are some commonly used options:

**Frameworks:**

- React (JavaScript or TypeScript), Next.js, Vue, Svelte, plain HTML/CSS

**Styling:**

- Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components, plain CSS

**Component Libraries:**

- shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Chakra UI, Material UI, or your own custom components

### Specifying Your Stack

Mention your preferred technologies in the prompt so the AI generates code that fits your project:

```
Generate Next.js 14 code with Tailwind CSS
```

```
Create a Vue component using TypeScript
```

```
Use shadcn/ui components for this layout
```

## Icon Libraries

### Built-in vs Code Libraries

**In Pencil:**

- Pencil includes the following built-in icon libraries: Material Symbols (Outlined, Rounded, Sharp), Lucide Icons, Feather, and Phosphor.
- You can also import your own SVG icons the same way as individual images.

**For code generation:**

- Specify your preferred library in prompts
- Common options: Lucide, Heroicons, FontAwesome, React Icons

**Example:**

```
Generate this design using Lucide icons
```

```
Replace Material Icons with Heroicons in the code
```
