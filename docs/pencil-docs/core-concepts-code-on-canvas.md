## Code on Canvas

## What is Code on Canvas?

Pencil uses the **Script node** to bring code to the canvas. Drop one onto the canvas, point it at a `.js` file, and the script’s output renders as nested layers — pie charts, grids, decorative patterns, anything you can describe in code.

Use it whenever a design needs structure that’s tedious to build by hand: things driven by data, repeated with variations, or parameterized by a few knobs you want to tweak interactively.

## Getting Started

### Create a script node

1. Open the **Shape tool dropdown** in the toolbar.
2. Pick **Script** (the `</>` icon).
3. Click anywhere on the canvas to drop a 200×200 script node.

The new node will show a green **“No script file selected”** placeholder until you point it at a `.js` file.

### Link it to a.js file

In the **properties panel**, type a path into the script field. Paths are resolved relative to your `.pen` file, so a sibling file is just `chart.js`. Save the JS file in the same folder as the `.pen` file (or any subfolder) and reference it from there.

You don’t need to write the script by hand. Two easy starting points:

1. **Grab a ready-made script.** Browse [highagency/pencil-scripts](https://github.com/highagency/pencil-scripts) for example scripts maintained by the Pencil team (charts, grids, patterns, and more) and drop them next to your `.pen` file as a starting point.
2. **Ask the AI agent.** Open the agent panel and describe what you want — it will create the `.js` file for you and link it to the selected script node.

Example prompt:

```
Create a script that renders a horizontal bar chart with 5 bars.
Add inputs for the bar color, gap between bars, and an array of values.
```

A minimal script looks like this:

```
/**
 * @schema 2.11
 *
 * @input columns: number(min=1) = 3
 * @input color: color = #3B82F6
 */
const cols = Math.floor(pencil.input.columns);
const cellW = pencil.width / cols;
 
const nodes = [];
for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
  nodes.push({
    type: "rectangle",
    x: c * cellW,
    y: 0,
    width: cellW - 4,
    height: pencil.height,
    fill: pencil.input.color,
  });
}
return nodes;
```

Here’s that exact script rendered inside a 200×200 script node:

As soon as the file resolves, the script runs and its output appears inside the node’s bounds.

### Tweak it on the canvas

- **Resize the node** — drag the handles to resize the node, or change the size in the properties panel. The script re-runs and the layout reflows live.
- **Use the input controls** — every `@input` line in the script header becomes a control in the properties panel. Numbers, strings, booleans, colors, enum dropdowns, and references to existing components are all supported. Editing a control re-runs the script instantly.
- **Edit the `.js` file** — Pencil watches the file on disk. Save in your editor and the canvas updates without a reload.
- **Convert to layers** — whenever you need to edit the generated content by hand, click the button at the bottom of the properties panel. The script node is replaced with a regular frame containing a snapshot of the generated layers.

Bind a script input to a [variable](https://docs.pencil.dev/core-concepts/variables) (like `$primary`) and the script automatically picks up theme changes.

## How it Works

A few details worth knowing:

- **The `.js` file lives outside the `.pen` file.** The script node only stores a *path* to it. Multiple script nodes can point at the same file; each gets its own size and input values.
- **Inputs are declared in the file header.** The `@input` lines in the header comment tell Pencil which controls to render in the properties panel. Rename or remove an input in the file and the panel updates.
- **Scripts return an array of nodes.** Each returned object uses the same schema as the rest of Pencil and is inserted as a child of the script node.
- **Output is derived state.** Generated children re-render every time the script runs and are *not* part of the undo history. To turn them into editable layers, use **Convert to layers**.
- **Scripts run in a sandbox.** They don’t have access to the DOM, network, or filesystem, and must run synchronously (no async, no `setTimeout`).
- **`Math.random()` is deterministic.** It is reseeded on every run, so the same inputs always produce the same output.

Errors and missing files are shown directly on the node, with the failing line of code highlighted — no need to open a console.

## API Reference

### File header

Every script starts with a header comment declaring its schema version and the inputs it exposes.

```
/**
 * @schema <version>
 * @input <name>: <type>[(<args>)] [= <default>]
 */
```

- `@schema` — required. Use `2.11` (current schema version).
- `@input` — zero or more. Each one becomes a control in the properties panel. The name is also the key used on `pencil.input`.

### Input types

| Type | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | `@input size: number(min=0, max=100) = 10` | Optional `min` / `max` named args clamp the value before the script runs. |
| `string` | `@input label: string = "Hello"` | Multi-line text in the panel. |
| `boolean` | `@input filled: boolean = true` | Rendered as a checkbox. |
| `color` | `@input fill: color = #3B82F6` | Hex literal or a quoted string. |
| `enum` | `@input layout: enum("grid", "stack") = "grid"` | Positional list of quoted options, rendered as a dropdown. |
| `ref` | `@input target: ref` | Reference to a reusable component, picked from a thumbnail grid. |

### The pencil global

Your script body runs with a single `pencil` argument:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pencil.width` | `number` | Current width of the script node. |
| `pencil.height` | `number` | Current height of the script node. |
| `pencil.input.<name>` | matches the `@input` type | Current value of the named input (already clamped and validated). |

### Return value

- The script must `return` an array of node objects. Each object follows the [.pen format](https://docs.pencil.dev/for-developers/the-pen-format).
- A script can return at most **1000 nodes** and must finish within **2 seconds**.

### Example

```
/**
 * @schema 2.11
 *
 * @input rows: number(min=1, max=20) = 5
 * @input gap: number(min=0) = 6
 * @input fill: color = #10B981
 * @input rounded: boolean = true
 */
const rows = Math.floor(pencil.input.rows);
const gap = pencil.input.gap;
const rowH = (pencil.height - gap * (rows - 1)) / rows;
 
const nodes = [];
for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
  nodes.push({
    type: "rectangle",
    x: 0,
    y: r * (rowH + gap),
    width: pencil.width,
    height: rowH,
    cornerRadius: pencil.input.rounded ? 8 : 0,
    fill: pencil.input.fill,
  });
}
return nodes;
```
